Contact: [Ivan Vulić](https://sites.google.com/site/ivanvulic/) (iv250 AT cam DOT ac DOT uk)

This repo contains bilingual lexicons for 210 language pairs (15 languages in total) used in the empirical comparison paper [Do We Really Need Fully Unsupervised Cross-Lingual Embeddings?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01638.pdf) (Vulić et al., EMNLP 2019)

The bilingual lexicons have been extracted from the [PanLex](https://panlex.org/) database of translations: more details on the extraction procedure are provided in the paper.
